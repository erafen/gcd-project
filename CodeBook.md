This file describes the transformations applied on the original dataset to produce the [averages.txt](averages.txt) and the structure of the resulting dataset.

This document is organized in two sections. The first one is dedicated to the transformations and the second one to a detailed description of the contents of the resulting dataset.

# Transformations

Transformations realized in the script follow the steps of the assignment:

1. Read the datasets into data frame and merge the observations into the data frame "variables", the subjects into "subjects" and the activities into "activities". Descriptive names are set for each variable in each data frame.
2. Measurements not related to mean or standard deviation are extracted from the data frame. Additionnaly, a complete data frame "df" is created. df contains the observations (variables) along with the subject and activity.
3. Activity variable is replaced with its corresponding label using the activity_labels.txt dataset.
4. Descriptive names have been set for each variable during step 1.
5. The data frame "df" is grouped by subject and activity, and means are computed for each variable in each group.

Finally the resulting dataset is written to [averages.txt](averages.txt)

# Variables

The features come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag).

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals).

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:
'X', 'Y', 'Z are used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are:

. mean: Mean value
. std: Standard deviation

Subject indicates the subject who performs the activity, and "activity" describe the activity performed.
