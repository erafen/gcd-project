This file describes the transformations applied on the original dataset to produce the [averages.txt](averages.txt) and the structure of the resulting dataset.

This document is organized in two sections. The first one is dedicated to the transformations and the second one to a detailed description of the contents of the resulting dataset.

# Transformations

Transformations realized in the script follow the steps of the assignment:

1. Read the datasets into data frame and merge the observations into the data frame "variables", the subjects into "subjects" and the activities into "activities". Descriptive names are set for each variable in each data frame.
2. Measurements not related to mean or standard deviation are extracted from the data frame. Additionnaly, a complete data frame "df" is created. df contains the observations (variables) along with the subject and activity.
3. Activity variable is replaced with its corresponding label using the activity_labels.txt dataset.
4. Descriptive names have been set for each variable during step 1.
5. The data frame "df" is grouped by subject and activity, and means are computed for each variable.

Finally the resulting dataset is written to [averages.txt](averages.txt)

# Variables

The resulting dataset contains the following variables:
